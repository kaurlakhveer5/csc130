This was an Alogrithm design class assignment. We need to create a giat array of random numbers. Then take one number at a time and start building an AVL tree. When tree is built, then, built another AVL tree by removing the smallest node from the first tree and adding it to the new tree. The purpose was to learn, how to add and delete nodes in an AVL tree.
